Q 30.

      Pendulum
          Bob is doing a research in Pendulum. He is just pushing the pendulum aside and the pendulum started moving in to-and-fro motion. Bob will push the pendulum 
          always towards his right side to start the oscillation. Bob wanted to calculate the distance between extreme position and the centre position of pendulum for 
          each oscillations. He somehow calculated all the possible distance. Since he is busy in this research he is giving the task to his assistant who needs to 
          arrange the values as instructed.Since he is pushing the pendulum to his right always. He wanted to store that distance in the right extreme of the arrangement.
          And the pendulum will move towards the extreme left at that time he want that value to be stored in the left most extreme in the arrangement. And this continues
          till the pendulum stops. He is also sure that the distance reached at that oscillation will always be lesser than the previous oscillation towards that particular
          end.Write a program to arrange the distance as instructed.

                    Input : 5
                            { 1 3 2 5 4 }

Q 32.

      Lockdown game
          In this lockdown a family of N members decided to play a game the rules of which are :-
          All N members are made to sit uniformly in a circle (ie. from 1 to N in clockwise direction).
          The game start with the person sitting at first position.
          A song is played in the background. The lyrics of the song are denoted by a string which consists of only letters 'x' and 'y'. Assume that each lyric of the song 
          is a single letter. If the lyric 'x' occurs in the song, the member who is currently holding the Parcel passes it on to the next member. This passing takes place in 
          clockwise direction.If the lyric 'y' occurs in the song, the member who is currently holding the Parcel loses his/her chances of winning the game. He/she hands over 
          the parcel to the next member (in clockwise direction) and moves out.The game continues until a single member survives in the end. He/she will be the winner of the game.
          Note that the song repeats continuously ie. while the game is going on, if at all the song ends, the stereo system will automatically start playing the song from the 
          start without any delay.You have to find out the member who wins the game.

                   Input : 3
                           xyx
                   Output : 1

                   Explanation:  Starting from 1 lyrics : 'x' therefore he passes the ballto 2nd 
                                 2nd turn lyrics : 'y' therefore 2nd member gets out of game and passes to 3rd
                                 3rd turn lyrics : 'x' therefore 3rd passes ball to first.
                                 4th turn lyrics : 'x' passes to 3rd 
                                 5th turn lyrics: 'y' therefore gets eliminated.
                                 Hence person sitting at position 1 won this game.
